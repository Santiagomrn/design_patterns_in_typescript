# The STRATEGY Pattern

The Strategy Pattern lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one in a class, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Design Principles

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. (take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't)
- Program to an interface not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance

## Run the code example

Inside the /strategy

```bash
npm start
```
