# The ITERATOR Pattern

The Iterator Pattern lets you traverse the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Design Principles

- A class should have only one reason to change.

## Run the code example

Inside the /iterator

```bash
npm start
```
