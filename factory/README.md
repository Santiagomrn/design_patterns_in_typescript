# The Factory Pattern

## The Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object in a superclass, but allows subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## The Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern lets you produce families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Design Principles

- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

## Run the code example

Inside the /factory

```bash
npm start
```
