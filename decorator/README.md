# The DECORATOR Pattern

The Decorator Pattern lets you attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Design Principles

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Run the code example

Inside the /decorator

```bash
npm start
```
