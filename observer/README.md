# The OBSERVER Pattern

The Observer Pattern lets you define a subscription mechanism between objects so that when one object changes state all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Design Principles

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
  (Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects)

## Run the code example

Inside the /observer directory

```bash
npm start
```
